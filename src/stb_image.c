| Just in case anyone gets here and wonders what |
| this is, #include "stb_image.h" will expand to |
| an entire implementation of the library. The   |
| `#define` is needed to do so, as otherwise the |
| expanded version would just be the header and  |
| that wouldn't be too useful.                   |
