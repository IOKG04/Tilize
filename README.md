# Tilize

> Do you think your images have too many distinct pixel groups? This might help :3

## For Users

If you plan on using Tilize, [this](for_users.md) is your file to read, please do so before wondering why stuff doesn't work :3

But in short, download the newest version of Tilize from the [Releases](https://github.com/IOKG04/Tilize/releases) section,
open the directory containing it in the terminal (or the command line, depending on how you want to call it),
run `.\Tilize help` and then use it as you would any other terminal software.

## For Developers

If you are planning to develop for Tilize, [this](for_devs.md) is the file for you, please read through it :3

In short though, clone the repo, run `premake5 [your build system]` and then build it,
write any c code in strictly complient c11 and any scripts in Lua.  
Also read though [for_users.md](for_users.md) of course, it might be pretty helpful to know what it is supposed to do.
