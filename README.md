# Tilize

> Do you think your images have too many distinct pixel groups? This might help :3

## Function

Once this is done, which it isn't as of writing this, this tool should be able to take an image,
split it into n by m rectangles, then choose which of a given number of patterns and color combinations
preserves that rectangle best, and then replace it with that, resulting in an image made entirely of tiles.

For now though, that isn't the case yet. I need to build the software first.
